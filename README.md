Chatbomb v2.1

Lots of changes from the original Chatbomb:<br>
<ul>
<li>Completely redesigned UI/UX</li>
<li>Dropping Rails in favor of an Express/MongoDB-based API</li>
<li>Using PassportJS and JSON Web Tokens for user authentication instead of the Facebook SDK</li>
<li>Fixing the numerous glaring bugs lulz</li>
<li>Completely redesigned in every which way from the ground up</li>
</ul>

When it gets closer to completion, I'll update this Readme with all of the features.
